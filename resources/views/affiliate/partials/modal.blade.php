                        we detect any action on your side that doesn’t match our affiliate system terms or our concept
                        on fair and proper affiliate linking we keep the right to exclude you from the option of using
                        the affiliate system, withhold your earnings and disable your account. We decide this very
                        carefully and senseful. </p>
                    <p>We always keep the right to decide whether to exclude someone from our affiliate system. If we
                        find you breaking our terms and moral values we might exclude you from the affiliate program and
                        withhold any generated affiliate earnings and disable your account.

                        free bank transfer is $100. Please note that if an already sold item receives a chargeback
                        (meaning that an item has been bought, mostly with credit card and then had been refunded again)
                        you will not receive earnings for this item.</p>
